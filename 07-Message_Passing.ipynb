    "A transfer of data from one process to another is called a point-to-point communication. These are achieved through the `send` and `recv` functions or their *immediate* counter-parts, `isend` and `irecv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"Blocking point-to-point communication.\"\"\"\n",

    "In the above example, both processes start with a zero tensor, then process 0 increments the tensor and sends it to process 1 so that they both end up with 1.0. Notice that process 1 needs to allocate memory in order to store the data it will receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice that `send`/`recv` are **blocking**: both processes stop until the communication is completed. On the other hand immediates are **non-blocking**; the script continues its execution and the methods return a `DistributedRequest` object upon which we can choose to `wait()`.\n",

    "```\n",

    "Running the above function might result in process 1 still having 0.0 while having already started receiving. However, after `req.wait()` has been executed we are guaranteed that the communication took place, and that the value stored in `tensor[0]` is 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point-to-point communication is useful when we want a fine-grained control over the communication of our processes. They can be used to implement fancy algorithms, such as the one used in [Baidu's DeepSpeech](https://github.com/baidu-research/baidu-allreduce) or [Facebook's large-scale experiments](https://research.fb.com/publications/imagenet1kin1h/).)\n",
