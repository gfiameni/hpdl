    "Deep Neural Network training has traditionally relied on IEEE single-precision format, however with mixed precision, you can train with half precision while maintaining the network accuracy achieved with single precision. This technique of using both single- and half-precision representations is referred to as mixed precision technique.\n",

    "- Speeds up math-intensive operations, such as linear and convolution layers, by using Tensor Cores.\n",
    "- Speeds up memory-limited operations by accessing half the bytes compared to single-precision.\n",
