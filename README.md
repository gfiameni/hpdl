# Welcome to this repo about High Performance Deep Learning

This repository contains different example Jupyter notebooks dealing with large-scale models training. They are inspired by materials, examples, exercies mainly taken from official PyTorch tutotials and other authors. Each notebook contains the list of reference material. 


# Prerequisites
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html), the primitives it provides for [writing distributed applications](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html) as well as training [distributed models](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).
