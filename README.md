# Welcome to the lab of the "High performance computing and large-scale models" course

This repository contains different example Jupyter notebooks dealing with large-scale models training. They are inspired by materials, examples, exercies mainly taken from official PyTorch tutotials and other authors. Each notebook contains the list of reference manterial. 


# Launching and configuring distributed data parallel applications

This notebook demonstrates how to structure a distributed model training application so it can be launched conveniently on multiple nodes, each with multiple GPUs using PyTorch's distributed
[launcher script](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html).

# Prerequisites
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html), the primitives it provides for [writing distributed applications](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html) as well as training [distributed models](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).
