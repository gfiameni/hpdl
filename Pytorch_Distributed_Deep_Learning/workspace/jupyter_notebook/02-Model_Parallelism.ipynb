    "\n",
    "Model parallel is widely-used in distributed training techniques. Into the previous notebook we have explained how to use [DataParallelism](01-Data_Parallelism.ipynb) to train a neural network on multiple GPUs; this feature replicates the same model to all GPUs, where each GPU consumes a different partition of the input data. Although it can significantly accelerate the training process, it does not work for some use cases where the model is too large to fit into a single GPU. This shows how to solve that problem by using **model parallelism**, which, in contrast to `DataParallel`, splits a single model onto different GPUs, rather than replicating the entire model on each GPU (to be concrete, say a model `m` contains 10 layers: when using `DataParallel`, each GPU will have a replica of each of these 10 layers, whereas when using model parallel on two GPUs, each GPU could host 5 layers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-level idea of model parallel is to place different parts of a model onto different devices, and implement the `forward pass` method accordingly to move intermediate outputs across devices. As only part of a model operates on any individual device, a set of devices can collectively serve a larger model. This notebook focuses on showing the idea of model parallel. \n",
