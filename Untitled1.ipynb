    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html), the primitives it provides for [writing distributed applications](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html) as well as training [distributed models](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The example program in this tutorial uses the\n",
    "[`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#distributeddataparallel) class for training models\n",
    "in a _data parallel_ fashion: multiple workers train the same global\n",
    "model by processing different portions of a large dataset, computing\n",
    "local gradients (aka _sub_-gradients) independently and then\n",
    "collectively synchronizing gradients using the AllReduce primitive. In\n",
    "HPC terminology, this model of execution is called _Single Program\n",
    "Multiple Data_ or SPMD since the same application runs on all\n",
    "application but each one operates on different portions of the\n",
    "training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Application process topologies\n",
    "A Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) application can be executed on\n",
    "multiple nodes where each node can consist of multiple GPU\n",
    "devices. Each node in turn can run multiple copies of the DDP\n",
    "application, each of which processes its models on multiple GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let _N_ be the number of nodes on which the application is running and\n",
    "_G_ be the number of GPUs per node. The total number of application\n",
    "processes running across all the nodes at one time is called the\n",
    "**World Size**, _W_ and the number of processes running on each node\n",
    "is referred to as the **Local World Size**, _L_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each application process is assigned two IDs: a _local_ rank in \\[0,\n",
    "_L_-1\\] and a _global_ rank in \\[0, _W_-1\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the terminology defined above, consider the case where a\n",
    "DDP application is launched on two nodes, each of which has four\n",
    "GPUs. We would then like each process to span two GPUs each. The\n",
    "mapping of processes to nodes is shown in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ProcessMapping](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875518/77676984-4c81e400-6f4c-11ea-87d8-f2ff505a99da.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are quite a few ways to map processes to nodes, a good\n",
    "rule of thumb is to have one process span a single GPU. This enables\n",
    "the DDP application to have as many parallel reader streams as there\n",
    "are GPUs and in practice provides a good balance between I/O and\n",
    "computational costs. In the rest of this tutorial, we assume that the\n",
    "application follows this heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preparing and launching a DDP application\n",
    "Independent of how a DDP application is launched, each process needs a\n",
    "mechanism to know its global and local ranks. Once this is known, all\n",
    "processes create a `ProcessGroup` that enables them to participate in\n",
    "collective communication operations such as AllReduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convenient way to start multiple DDP processes and initialize all\n",
    "values needed to create a `ProcessGroup` is to use the distributed\n",
    "`launch.py` script provided with PyTorch. The launcher can be found\n",
    "under the `distributed` subdirectory under the local `torch`\n",

    "When the DDP application is started via `launch.py`, it passes the world size, global rank, master address and master port via environment variables and the local rank as a command-line parameter to each instance.\n",
    "To use the launcher, an application needs to adhere to the following convention:\n",
    "1. It must provide an entry-point function for a _single worker_. For example, it should not launch subprocesses using `torch.multiprocessing.spawn`\n",
    "2. It must use environment variables for initializing the process group.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "As the author of a distributed data parallel application, your code needs to be aware of two types of resources: compute nodes and the GPUs within each node. The process of setting up bookkeeping to track how the set of GPUs is mapped to the processes of your application can be tedious and error-prone. We hope that by structuring your application as shown in this example and using the launcher, the mechanics of setting up distributed training can be significantly simplified."
