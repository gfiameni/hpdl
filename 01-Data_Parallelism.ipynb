    "Terms used in distributed training:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **master node**: the main GPU responsible for synchronizations, making copies, loading models, writing checkpoints and logs;\n",
    "- **process group**: if you want to train/test the model over K GPUs, then the K process forms a group, which is supported by a backend (pytorch managed that for you, according to the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.9.0/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html?highlight=distributeddataparallel#torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel), nccl is the most recommended backend);\n",
    "- **rank**: within the process group, each process is identified by its rank, from 0 to K-1;\n",
    "- **world size**: the number of processes in the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides two settings for distributed training: `torch.nn.DataParallel` (DP) and `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` (DDP), where the latter is officially recommended. In short, DDP is faster, more flexible than DP. **The fundamental thing DDP does is to copy the model to multiple gpus, gather the gradients from them, average the gradients to update the model, then synchronize the model over all K processes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also gather/scatter tensors/objects other than gradients by torch.distributed.gather/scatter/reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case the model can fit on one GPU (it can be trained on one GPU with batch_size = 1) and we want to train/test it on K GPUs, the best practice of DDP is to copy the model onto the K GPUs (the DDP class automatically does this for you) and split the dataloader to K non-overlapping groups to feed into K models respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make your model leverages multiple GPUS, this is the list of steps to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. setup the process group, which is three lines of code and needs no modification;\n",
    "2. split the dataloader to each process in the group, which can be easily achieved by `torch.utils.data.DistributedSampler` or any customized sampler;\n",
    "3. wrap our model with DDP, which is one line of code and barely needs modification;\n",
    "4. train/test our model, which is the same as is on 1 GPU;\n",
    "5. clean up the process groups, which is one line of code;\n",
    "6. optional: gather extra data among processes (possibly needed for distributed testing), which is basically one line of code."

As you can see, such padding may cause issues because the padded 0 is a data record. Otherwise, it will strip off the trailing elements. For example, it splits the indices to `[0,3,6]` at `rank=1`, `[1,4,7]` at `rank=2`, and `[2,5,8]` at `rank=3`. In this case, it tailored 9 to make the indice number divisible by `world_size`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Set random seed to make sure that the models initialized in different processes are the same. \n",
    "- Use `DistributedDataParallel` to wrap the model for distributed training.\n",
    "- Use `DistributedSampler` to training data loader.\n",
    "- To save models, each node would save a copy of the checkpoint file in the local hard drive.\n",
    "- Downloading dataset and making directories should be avoided in the distributed training program as they are not multi-process safe, unless we use some sort of barriers, such as `torch.distributed.barrier`.\n",
    "- The node communication bandwidth are extremely important for multi-node distributed training. Instead of randomly finding two computers in the network, try to use the nodes from the specialized computing clusters, since the communications between the nodes are highly optimized."
